The dataset doesn’t confirm to the variable definitions. There are duplicate barcodes but the entries are usually random values like , test%. It seems like there is test data in this dataset.

An exploratory analysis revealed the following : 

Users

•	Duplicate records 
    Total entries : 495
    After removing duplicates : 212
    
•	Missing value
    lastLogin: 62 ; length(which(is.na(users$lastLogin)))
    state:56 ; length(which(users$state == "-"))
    signUpSource:48; length(which(users$signUpSource == "-"))
    role = fetch-staff, 8 when it is supposed to be set to CONSUMER 
    
•	Topbrand is supposed to be Boolean but contains 0 and 1

•	Not all users are in the receipts 

•	The quantity in the receipts might not match the quantity in receipts list

•	All the accounts are marked as active 1, but it seems like 40 accounts don’t have a lastLogin. Probably these users created an account but never confirmed it via email link or logged in using the app
