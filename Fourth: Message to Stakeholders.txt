The dataset requires various forms of manipulation before it can be useful for analytics. Broadly, these issues can be categorized as follows: 

 Data Collection:  
    There is duplication of data, mismatched users in different tables, and invalid variable entries.
 
 Integrity Issues: 
    It seems like the dataset contains data from dev/test environment due to unintended transfer or misconfiguration. The presence of dummy users and test brands is quite evident in the dataset.   

The above can be addressed by adequate cleaning, handling missing values, and removing duplicate values. The character string encoding issues can be appropriately dealt with via a programming language. The timestamps require conversion from UNIX to human readable form to answer business questions. 
I believe that working closely with Data Engineering team and project managers can help achieve the business objective in an effective and efficient manner. 

I am happy to delve deep into the technicalities with the appropriate stakeholders.
